  <li>
    In a Newton's rings experiment, the diameter of the 10<sup>th</sup> ring changes from 14 mm to 12.7 mm when a drop of water is introduced between the lens and the plate. Calculate the refractive index of the liquid.
  </li>

  <li>
    A plano-convex lens of radius 3 m is placed on an optically flat glass plate with acetone and is illuminated by monochromatic light. The diameter of the 8<sup>th</sup> dark ring in the reflected system is 7.2 mm. Calculate the wavelength of the light used.
  </li>

  <li>
    A thin equi-convex lens of focal length 4 m and refractive index 1.5 is placed on an optically flat glass plate. Using a light of wavelength 546 nm, Newton's rings are viewed normally by reflection. What is the diameter of the fifth bright ring?
  </li>

  <li>
    Newton’s rings are observed by keeping a spherical surface of 100 cm radius on a glass plate with isopropyl alcohol. The wavelength of light used is 5880 Å. If the diameter of the 15<sup>th</sup> bright ring is 0.60 cm, then what is the diameter of the 5<sup>th</sup> ring?
  </li>

  <li>
    Monochromatic light with a wavelength of 648 nm shines down on a plano-convex lens atop a plate glass with kerosene. Newton's rings are seen when viewed from a superior position. 
    <br>(a) Radius of the 6<sup>th</sup> bright ring is 0.78 cm. What is the radius of curvature of the lens?
    <br>(b) If the light is changed to a greater wavelength, will the 6<sup>th</sup> ring be in the same position?
  </li>
